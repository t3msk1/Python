# Day 3 Python Project: Treasure Hunt

## Task
- Display backgroup story of the game.
- Ask user for permission using (yes/no) prompt.
- Using while loop to validate (yes/no) input.
- It's Level 1 game so it's very simple.
- Display the user with the series of branching choices.

## Challange
The challange is to managing the game's flow and logic. This involved:
- Organizing the code into seperate functions.
- Repeatedly ask for input until it gets a valid (yes/no).
- Function to act as a signal to either start or stop the main game
- Building the branching paths for the adventure using nested conditional
- Ensuring all possible user inputs were accounted to prevent from crashing

## What I Learn
- Structure a complete program by defining and calling multiple functions.
- How to use 'while True' loop with 'return' statements tp create a validated input.
- How 'return True/False' can be stored in a variable to control the program's flow using an 'if' statement.
- Branching narrative using nested conditional.
- Preventing capitalized error in user's input.
