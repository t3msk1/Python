# Day 2 Python Project: Tip Calculator

## Task
- Create a program that calculate the tips from the final bill.
- Asking for the total bill (as a 'float').
- Asking for the desire tip precentage (as a 'float').
- Calculate the tip amount and the new total bill.
- Display the result to the user.

## Challange
The challange is to find a way to formatting the output
- Display '10000' if the number was '10000.0'.
- But still display '12506.25' if the number actually had decimal values.

## What I Learn
- How to take user input and convert it to the 'float' data type.
- Perform basic aritmetic calculation with 'float's.
- Using f-strings in python for output formatting.
- Apply conditional logic directly inside an f-string.
- Use '.is_integer()' method to check if 'float' has a whole value.
